# ADR 03 – Testing Strategy with pytest

## Overview
Because this project is forked from an open-source Finance Tracker, our main contribution focuses on improving reliability and maintainability through automated testing. The original repository did not include a formal test suite.

## Decision
We decided to add a lightweight but meaningful testing strategy based on:

- **pytest** as the test runner.
- A **tests/** directory to organize route and behavior tests.
- A shared **test client fixture** to simulate HTTP requests to the Flask app.
- Tests that focus on:
  - Route availability (e.g., `/`, `/login`, `/register`, `/transactions`, `/statistics`).
  - Correct status codes (200, 302, 404).
  - Redirect behavior for protected routes (e.g., redirecting unauthenticated users to `/login`).

## Rationale
- Automated tests give us confidence that core pages work as expected after changes.
- Route and redirect tests are fast and easy to run on any machine.
- A clear testing structure demonstrates good software engineering practice on top of the inherited codebase.
- Using pytest integrates well with Python and Flask and matches course expectations.

## Consequences

### Pros
- Increases confidence when refactoring or extending the app.
- Provides quick feedback if a route is accidentally removed or broken.
- Makes the project look more professional and complete for the final report.

### Cons
- Current tests focus on high-level behavior and do not cover every edge case or database scenario.
- More detailed tests (e.g., full login + transaction flows) would require additional setup and test data.
