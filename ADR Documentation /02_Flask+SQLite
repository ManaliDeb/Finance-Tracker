# ADR 0002 – Flask + SQLite Technology Stack

## Overview
We built the Finance Tracker on top of the **Flask web framework** with **SQLite** as the database, to keep the stack lightweight and easy to run for this class project.

## Decision
We intentionally adopted and refined the existing technology stack:

- **Flask** – Web framework used for routing, sessions, templating, and request handling.

- **SQLite** – Lightweight, file-based database for storing users and transactions.

- **Jinja2** – Template engine used to generate dynamic HTML views.

## Rationale
- Flask is simple, flexible, and ideal for a small project.
- SQLite requires no external server, making it easy to run the project.
- The inherited stack reduced setup overhead but still allowed us to apply architectural patterns, testing, and documentation practices.
- Flask integrates naturally with Jinja2, which supports MVC principles through template-based views.


## Consequences

### Pros
- Easy environment setup (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- No separate database needed.
- Lightweight and fast enough for development/demo.
- Maintains compatibility with the open-source fork.

### Cons
- SQLite is not designed for high-concurrency production workloads.
- Flask requires manual implementation of some features
